Homework assignments for MIT's 6.189 course

Hello!

My name is Catarina and I'm a 20 year old girl from Portugal. 
I just recently got into programming and I was told Python was where it's at. At least for a total beginner like me.
So watch me (painfully) go through MIT's 6.189 "A Gentle Introduction to Programming Using Python" as I commit my wannabe code here.

Thanks for reading this!
